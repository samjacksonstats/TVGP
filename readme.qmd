This repository contains code to support the paper "Tensor-variate Gaussian process regression for efficient emulation of complex systems: comparing regressor and covariance structures in outer product and parallel partial emulators" by Semochkina[^soton], Jackson[^durham] and Woods[^soton].

The code is structured as follows:

 - each of the folders "influenza_model" and "environmental_model" contains code to generate example results from the paper for the respective simulators.
 - within each of these folders, there is an "*_emulation.R" script that runs the emulation and produces the results.
 - the "code" folders contain the functions (and data) used in the emulation scripts.
